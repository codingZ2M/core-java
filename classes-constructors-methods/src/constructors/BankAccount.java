/*
  Constructor is member method
  Every class will get a default constructor if you don't create one explicitly
  Constructor don't return anything.
  At least one constructor should be invoked during object creation
  Constructor will determine the memory required to your object, will be used to allocate memory
  Can be used to provide initial values to your object properties/variables. 
  A class can have more than one constructor, provided they have different parameters. (Constructor Overloading)
  
  'this' is used to refer the current object on which the constructor is invoked
